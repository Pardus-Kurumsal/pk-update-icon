pk-update-icon
==============

Description
-----------

pk-update-icon displays notifications and an icon in the tray area of the panel
when package updates are available.

Build Instructions
------------------

pk-update-icon requires a POSIX:2004 compatible operating system, it has been
tested to work on Linux distributions.  The following tools and shared
libraries are required to build pk-update-icon:

- GNU make >= 3.81
- pkg-config
- GNU gettext
- GNU or BSD install
- GLib version 2.30 or later
- GTK+ version 2.24 or later
- libunique
- libnotify
- PackageKit-glib2

Rebuilding the man pages additionally requires the xsltproc tool from libxml2.

Before building pk-update-icon check the commented macros in the Makefile for
any macros you may need to override depending on the used toolchain and
operating system.

By default, all files will be installed under the "/usr/local" directory, a
different installation path prefix can be set via the `prefix` macro.  In
addition, a second path prefix can be specified via the `DESTDIR` macro which
will be prepended to any path, incuding the `prefix` macro path prefix.  In
contrast to `prefix`, the path specified via the `DESTDIR` macro will only be
prepended to paths during installation and not be used for constructing
internal paths.

The following instructions assume that `make` is GNU make, on some platforms
it may be installed under a different name or a non-default path.  In order to
start the build process run `make all`.  After a successful build, run `make
install` to install the program, any associated data files and the
documentation.

Previously built binaries, object files, generated data files and
documentation can be removed by running `make clean`, any additional,
generated files which are not removed by the `clean` target can be removed by
running `make clobber`.

Bug Reports
-----------

When sending bug reports, please always mention the exact version of
pk-update-icon with which the issue occurs as well as the version of the
operating system you are using and make sure that you provide sufficient
information to reproduce the issue and include any input, output, any error
messages.

In case of build issues, please also specify the implementations and versions
of the tools and shared libraries used to build the program, in particular the
compiler.

In case of crashes, please generate a stack trace with a suitable debugger
such as gdb, lldb, dbx, or debug after a crash has occurred either by
examining the resulting core file or by running the program from the debugger
and attach it to the bug report.  In order to generate a meaningful stack
trace the program as well as any dynamically linked libraries need to be built
with debugging information, see the documentation of the used compiler for the
required compiler flags.  If any of the dynamically linked shared libraries do
not contain debugging information, please either install debugging information
for these libraries using mechanisms provided by your operating system or
rebuild the libraries accordingly.  Please refer to the documentation of the
debugger for detailed instructions on generating backtraces.
